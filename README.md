<br>This is the beginning of the CamSluts app,</br>
<br>the code is still very buggy, and not fully functional..</br>
<br>You are welcome to have a look at the code...</br>
<br>but I can only guarantee that everything works to some extent from the pre-alpha release.</br>
<br>I have included a beautiful example of real infinity scrolling in this app,</br>
<br>maybe it will help some to understand what infinity scroll and pagination... is.</br>
<br>When people say it's the same... I just have to laugh tiredly,</br>
<br>scroll actions are one of my favorite disciplines like tcp,</br>
<br>and social engineering... Keep an eye on ongoing updates,</br>
<br>Peace out! SoldGear</br>
