This is the beginning of the CamSluts app,
the code is still very buggy, and not fully functional..
You are welcome to have a look at the code...
but I can only guarantee that everything works to some extent from the pre-alpha release.
I have included a beautiful example of real infinity scrolling in this app,
maybe it will help some to understand what infinity scroll and pagination... is.
When people say it's the same... I just have to laugh tiredly,
scroll actions are one of my favorite disciplines like tcp,
and social engineering... Keep an eye on ongoing updates,
Peace out! SoldGear
