<br>This is the beginning of the CamSluts app,</br>
the code is still very buggy, and not fully functional..<br>
You are welcome to have a look at the code...</br>
<br>But I can only guarantee that everything works to some extent from the pre-alpha release.<br>
I have included a beautiful example of real infinity scrolling in this app,</br>
maybe it will help some to understand what infinity scroll and pagination... is.<br>
When people say it's the same... I just have to laugh tiredly,</br>
scroll actions are one of my favorite disciplines like tcp,<br>
and social engineering... Keep an eye on ongoing updates,</br>
Peace out! SoldGear<br>
